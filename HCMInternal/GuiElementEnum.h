// A sequence of pairs, where the first element of a pair is the GUIElementEnum name, and the second element is a tuple of supported games for that guielement
// Indentation is cosmetic but indicates hiearchy of elements
//
// DO NOT put comments inside either sequence below - they are macro bodies, and a comment ends (or silently
// mangles) the continuation. Notes go here instead.
//
// Halo Campaign Evolved: cheatsHeadingGUI / overlaysHeadingGUI / cameraHeadingGUI are ALL_SUPPORTED_GAMES_AND_HALOCER
// so their hce* children can be constructed. That is not an MCC regression: every MCC-only child independently
// returns std::nullopt for HaloCER (see the "does not support Game" early-out in GUIElementConstructor.cpp), and
// GUIHeading sets hasElements = false and render() early-outs when every child is nullopt, so an all-nullopt
// heading draws nothing. Same reasoning as ALL_GAMES_AND_MAINMENU_AND_HALOCER above. Keep the three of them in
// sync with TOPGUIELEMENTS_RELEASE in GUIRequiredServices.h.
//
// requiredServicesPerGUIElement is keyed by GUIElementEnum ONLY, not by game, so an element cannot map to
// AIFreeze on Halo2 and HCEFreezeAI on HaloCER. That is why HaloCER gets parallel hce* elements rather than the
// MCC elements being widened - the same pattern hceForceCheckpointGUI already ships with.
//
// The hce* teleport/launch rows are absolute-coordinates only, so there is no radio group, applyToPlayer or
// customObject row. (The player view angle IS now resolved - see hcePlayerControl* in InternalPointerData.xml
// and HCEGetPlayerState::getPlayerViewAngle, which the trigger overlay uses - so a "relative to look direction"
// mode is possible; it just hasn't been built yet.) They reuse the MCC settings/events/hotkeys because HaloCER
// and the MCC games can never be in one process.
//
// TWO EXCEPTIONS to the "parallel hce* element" rule above, both deliberate:
//   havokDebuggerGUI just gains HaloCER in its own tuple. requiredServicesPerGUIElement maps it to
//   OptionalCheatEnum::HavokDebugger, which IS the correct cheat for HaloCER - HavokDebugger branches to
//   HceHavokDebuggerBridge internally. Same for speedhackGUI -> OptionalCheatEnum::Speedhack, whose mechanism
//   (hooking the timing exports) is engine-agnostic. Widening a tuple also costs no macro-nesting depth.
//   The trigger overlay does NOT qualify: OptionalCheatEnum::TriggerOverlay is MCC-only code, so HaloCER gets
//   parallel hceTriggerOverlay* elements in sequence 3 driving the SAME triggerOverlay* settings.

// Halo Campaign Evolved gui elements.
//
// These live in their own sequence for a MEASURED reason, not tidiness: appending them to sequence 2
// (which was already at 212 elements) made every translation unit that includes this header fail with
// C1009 "compiler limit: macros nested too deeply" at the GUIElementEnum definition below. That is MSVC's
// own preprocessor recursion limit, hit well before boost's BOOST_PP_LIMIT_SEQ of 256. Sequences 1 and 2
// are therefore back at exactly their pre-HaloCER contents - if you add more elements to either and see
// C1009, split again rather than trying to raise a limit.
//
// Sequence order does not imply gui order or hierarchy: both come from the createNestedElement child
// lists in GUIElementConstructor.cpp. Grouped by owning heading here purely for readability.

// ⚠ THIS ENUM IS TOO BIG FOR THE GLOBAL magic_enum RANGE, ON PURPOSE. It is the only one that is, so it
// carries its own range rather than making every other reflected enum pay for its size.
//
// magic_enum reflects by instantiating a __FUNCSIG__ probe for every candidate VALUE in [min, max], per
// enum. The global bound in pch.h is therefore a tax on all ~30 reflected enums, and raising it to fit this
// one is the expensive way round. MAGIC_ENUM_RANGE_MAX is 256 there - enough for everything else, and
// enough for the byte-backed enums that depend on it (see the warning in pch.h about LevelID).
//
// ⚠⚠ WHY 1024 AND NOT THE EXACT COUNT. The range is INCLUSIVE - magic_enum computes
// `range_size = max - min + 1` - so setting max to the highest enumerator leaves ZERO headroom and the very
// next GUI row you add silently loses its name. And "silently" is literal: an out-of-range enumerator does
// not fail to compile, it reflects as an empty string, so the symptom is blank entries in PLOG lines, in
// the "you forgot a creation case label" message, and in the GUIServiceInfo failure listings - the exact
// output you would be reading while trying to work out what broke. A comment here previously undercounted
// this enum by 132 and nearly caused that. 1024 is room for roughly another 530 rows.
//
// Measured 2026-08-17: list1 148 + list2 206 + list3 134 = 488 literal entries, plus 4
// defFreeCameraInterpolator lines that each expand to two = 492 enumerators, values 0..491.
// Re-measure by counting `((` lines per list rather than trusting this number.
//
// Must be visible in every TU that reflects this enum, which is why it lives in this header immediately
// under the definition rather than in a .cpp: a specialisation seen in some TUs and not others is an ODR
// violation, and magic_enum would quietly use different ranges in different objects.
